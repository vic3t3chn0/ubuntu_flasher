# ubuntu_flasher
Flasher for Sony Z Ultra with Ubuntu Phone

Before using this use the ubuntu installer for building the images.
git clone ubuntu_flash_installer

chmod a+x sony.sh

./sony.sh

The device folder it will be copied into device/sony

Then repeat ./sony.sh

I will give here at profile a kernel already working for Ubuntu.

In this repository will find the configs folder for flashing also the script.

chmod a+x Ultra-rootstock-installer


./Ultra-rootstock-installer wily-ubuntu.tar.gz system image

For this task you will need to be inside recovery like TWRP.
